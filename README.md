## About the project
This project is an application that enables the user to create dates The user can do multiple tasks with this program, including: creating multiple dates, displaying a specified date, incrementing an existing date, compare two dates, and display a sorted output of all dates created by the user in chronological order.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* show a basic understanding of classes and how they work, including the init constructor, setters, getters, and now polymorphism
* work on having application split up into multiple files
* further utilize the concept of encapsulation in this simple program and work with attributes that are made private to the user

In this program, the user can enter anything, even when prompted with entering an integer menu selection and a date, and the program will still function as intended.  It is important to note that if the year is a very large number, the comparison menu option may not work as intended and an error will occur.

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.

Once the project is open, you will be prompted with a menu display different menu options. To continue, you will need to enter a character that corresponds to one of the menu options; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

Once more than one date exists within a list declared within the application, the program will request an index that corresponds to that date's placement within the list from the user. Recall, in a list, the first element is at index zero, the second element is at index one, and so forth.  If no additional dates have been created other than the first date, then there will be no need to input a valid index--functionality for this is implemented within this application; however, if more than one date exists, then the user must input the date's index that he or she would like to work with.  For example, if there are two dates created, and you would like to display the second date, a menu would be printed to the screen showing all of the date that have been created.  To select the second date, input the character "1" when prompted to enter the date you would like to work with.
